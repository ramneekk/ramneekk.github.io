abstract = {Government welfare schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in India fund the creation of assets for natural resource management in rural villages to support farmers for their agricultural and livelihoods-based needs. With most agriculture in India being rain-fed, structures such as farm ponds, checkdams, trenches and bunds play a crucial role in supporting groundwater recharge and providing critical lifesaving irrigation in times of dry spells and droughts. In this study, we investigate the impact of farm ponds built under the MGNREGA scheme in Northern India as a source of protective irrigation for cropping areas in their immediate neighbourhood. We assess the impact of farm ponds on the following aspects: (i) we study their impact on agricultural productivity for up to five years since their construction, (ii) we separately study their impact in drought years during this period, (iii) we study the extent to which they are able to to reduce the sensitivity to droughts of sites having farm ponds. A causal analysis framework was designed by identifying control sites that did not have farm ponds, and the treatment effect of having farm ponds was computed using the difference-in-differences approach. Remote sensing data was processed to compute changes in vegetation indices around the treated and control locations before and after the construction of farm ponds. Our results indicate that farm ponds were instrumental in improving the agricultural productivity during the monsoon season in general. The impact during the monsoon season in drought years is also positive and significant. Furthermore, farm ponds also facilitated in reducing drought sensitivity during the monsoon season. The impact during the post-monsoon season was found to be lower, and the impact during the summer agricultural season was found to be the least.},

abstract={Input to the Most Navigable Path (MNP) problem consists of the following: (a) a road network represented as a directed graph, where each edge is associated with numeric attributes of cost and ``navigability score'' values; (b) a source and a destination and; (c) a budget value which denotes the maximum permissible cost of the solution. Given the input, MNP aims to determine a path between the source and the destination which maximizes the navigability score while constraining its cost to be within the given budget value. The problem can be modeled as the arc orienteering problem which is known to be NP-hard. The current state-of-the-art for this problem may generate paths having loops, and its adaptation for MNP that yields simple paths, was found to be inefficient. In this paper, we propose five novel algorithms for the MNP problem. Our algorithms first compute a seed path from the source to the destination, and then modify the seed path to improve its navigability. We explore two approaches to compute the seed path. For modification of the seed path, we explore different Dynamic Programming based approaches. We also propose an indexing structure for the MNP problem which helps in reducing the running time of some of our algorithms. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed solutions yield comparable or better solutions while being orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art for large real road networks.},

We developed an XGBoost based system which uses character and word level n-gram features represented using TF-IDF, count vector based correlation matrix, and predicts if an input news article is a hyperpartisan news article. Our model was able to achieve a precision of 68.3{\%} on the test set provided by the contest organizers. We also run our model on the BuzzFeed corpus and find XGBoost with simple character level N-Gram embeddings to be performing well with an accuracy of around 96{\%}."
